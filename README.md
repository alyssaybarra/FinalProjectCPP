To ensure this project runs smoothly, you'll need to install the Epic Games Launcher (for Unreal Engine 5.3.2) and JetBrains Rider IDE. It's crucial to avoid opening this application in CLion as it may lead to operational inconsistencies. Additionally, it's worth noting that specific code segments in this project aren't designed for compilation within an IDE. However, they are optimized for successful compilation within the Unreal Engine Editor.
